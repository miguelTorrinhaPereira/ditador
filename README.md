Ditador creates sayings from the text you give, your objective is to write all the words you hear whithout failling.

When you run the program it opens a windows with a text box where you can put the text to use. Above the text box you will have a button called 'Confirmar', if you click it you start the saying. There are also two text entrys, the first is for the number of random words, if you insert a number in this fild, it will chouse random words from the text. If you don´t put any number, it will read the words in order. The last fild is th number of words it will read at a time. IF you leave the entry empty it will say one word at a time, if you put 2 it will say 2 words at a time, and so on.

When the 'Confirmar' button is pressed the window changes and to numbers appear. The number in the left is the score of the word(or more if you chouse so in the first menu). In the begginig of each word the score is 10. If you fail to write the correctly the word the score drops to 5, then 2 and 0. If you get to 0 the correc speling of the word is shown. The other number is the total score, the some of the score of all words so far.

When you finish writting the text the screen will display 'acabaste!' and bellow 'pmpp = {some number from 0 to 10}'. pmpp is the average score per word. (pmpp stands for pontuação média por palavra)
